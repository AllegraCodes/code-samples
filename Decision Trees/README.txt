Built with python 3
Run from the command line for your environment, giving the names
of two csv files as arguments. The first argument is the name
of the csv file with the data set used for training, and the second
is the file to store the data with our generated features.

e.g. bash: "./SGAPproject3 input.csv output.csv"
Windows: "python3 SGAPproject3.py input.csv output.csv"

NOTE: This program performs experiments after reading and writing the data.
After the message "Features generated and written to <outfile>" you may
interrupt the program and view the output file
